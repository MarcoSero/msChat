# msChat
###A simple Java-based chat for educational purposes.

##How to Use
If you want test client and server in the same machine, just compile with

		$ java msClient

Instead, if you want test it in LAN or VPN or Internet, you have to set the variable "IP" in file msClient.java with the IP address (local or global) of machine where you want run msServer
